//I would like to create a calender that sits inside of the create component for me.

import React from "react"


//by by mentioning "extends React.Component what happens is that we gain all dependenceis, functionality and values that are included inside of the parent component"


class Calender extends React.Component {
    render (){
        <>
        <h1>suck my left nut</h1>
        <h1>{props}</h1>
        </>
    }
}

export default Calender
